Audio Gender and Age Detection
Overview
The Audio Gender and Age Detection project is a simple yet powerful tool that takes audio input from users, processes it using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and provides insights about the user's gender and estimated age. This project is designed for a wide range of applications, from speech analysis to user profiling.

Features
Audio Analysis: Utilize CNN to analyze audio data for gender and age detection.
User-Friendly: Simple input and output interfaces make it easy for users to interact with the system.
Graph Storage: Store audio graphs for future analysis and model training.
Customizable Models: Easily adapt or fine-tune the CNN model to meet your specific needs.
Usage
Requirements
Before using the project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python (3.6+)
NumPy
TensorFlow
Matplotlib (for graph visualization)
Getting Started
Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/audio-gender-age-detection.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd audio-gender-age-detection
Install the required Python packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the project:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
Follow the prompts to provide an audio input for analysis.

The program will process the audio and display the predicted gender and estimated age.

Customization
If you want to customize the CNN model or adapt it for different use cases, you can modify the model.py file. Be sure to retrain the model as needed.
